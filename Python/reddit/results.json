Why the fuck do copy paste COD and FIFA have to cost the same 70 as a generation defining game?\n\nI know rockstar is a rich company and I do not need to glaze them like this but to put things in prospective for you, candycrush, yes candy fucking crush makes same money as GTA 5 does. Rockstar is putting out a game that will be a new standard for a whole generation of games, it will innovate new mechanics and systems for the gaming industry.

        "selftext": "Recently they added steam achievements to it, and I just thought why not. I remember 3 being a fun time, and I had nothing immediately interesting me.\n\n\"\"SPOILERS\"\"\n\nIt's just a very fun game. Ever since Elden Ring's release (3rd year anniversary next month), I have been in a slump of no game would entice me to this level. I beat that game around 40 times, that's how good it was and nothing else really compared these past years. Closest I felt were Metaphor and Titanfall 2. Far Cry 4 has me actively looking forward to it, and making time for it by rushing my other daily duties.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIt's arcadey, no sim bullshit going on over here. But boy is that gameplay fun. Guns feel great to use, stealth is overpowered without being boring, vehicles are fun to drive and missions last just long enough without becoming tedious.\n\nI spent a couple hours today hunting for crafting materials, and could not find a particular goat on the map. I was scouring the map for it, when all of a sudden an eagle rose in front of me, carrying an animal that looked liked the goat, flew high and dropped it to it's death. I rushed to it, skinned it and completed my shit. But the moment felt so organic that you don't really go expecting in an Ubisoft game.\n\nSimilarly, I marked an outpost to liberate, and started driving towards it. Died fucking 6 times before I reached it lol. Each death was different, one of them involving a fucking Tiger attack as I was reloading...\n\nFor a co-op achievement, I hit the steam discussions, got someone who wanted one same as me, we joined and drove aimlessly for something like 30 minutes trying to get that. Even an impromptu co-op with a random for achievement hunting was an incredible time honestly.\n\nSetting:\n\nIt's incredible. I love everything mountains, and if you have ever been to that Himalayan region, they nailed the village looks and feel. The scenery is just very striking and quite fun to traverse through. It is an incredible openworld they made here.\n\nStory:\n\nI'll be honest, do not really care about it. I just wanted to have some silly fun. But in one choice of main mission, I had to choose between Sabal's (burn the opium fields) and Amitha's (protect and hijack them)\n\nNow, Sabal's argument was the land is more than it's people, and the opium fields are actively poisoning it. This is very close to how I feel about the world today, and with the looming threat of climate change and loss of biodiversity, I really empathized with his view.\n\nBut Amitha's reasoning was even if we won the civil war, there would be no economic future. Agriculture is destroyed, mines are empty, we need those fields at least temporarily.\n\nAs a grown man, I felt that to be significantly more logical and went with her view, protected the fields. But the entire time I hated what I was doing. I guess that's a part of what's growing up is all about, making decisions that you know are right, but not liking them. I play games to feel good, and did not even save the environment in a fictional setting. Hated that.\n\nBut post mission, Amitha told me she was set to be married at age 6. And suddenly you could feel she hated the closed, conservative setting that a man like Sabal would probably be indifferent or ignorant about. She simply wanted to move forward, and was ready for any drastic action. I do not agree with either of them, and still nodded sagely at the dichotomy of development and saving the environment. Incredibly immersive, that part, personally.\n\nFucking hell, to make someone care this much about a simple choice in a casual game like this. Brilliant.\n\nAll in all, I am now something like 30 hours in the game, and still look forward to my next session. These 30 hrs simply flew by.\n\nWhat a great fucking game.",

The games I\u2019m drawn to are ones that feel like movies.  **Not meaning \u201ccinematic\u201d**\u2014 moreso meaning story-first AAA games, where it feels like they wrote the script and THEN designed the game.\n\nObviously, unlike movies, game design doesn\u2019t generally work that way, but to me the best narrative design doesn\u2019t let on that they are sometimes writing it to justify the gameplay. Sometimes gameplay and story feel like two separate things, but the best is when it\u2019s one unified experience. \n\nFor example, despite being cinematic and having movie like moments, Call of Duty would be a bad example, because the story isn\u2019t so gripping that it\u2019s what\u2019s driving what\u2019s happening. \n\nMy examples here toe a very fine line which is why I\u2019m having trouble Googling it and previous threads with the same title haven\u2019t quite hit the mark for me: \n\nGood examples (which I\u2019ve played already) \n\n - Cyberpunk / RDR2 (both are open world but story is so strong throughout) \n - Witcher series\n - FFVII:Remake & Rebirth (mostly)\n - Indiana Jones & the Great Circle\n - Halo series\n - Gears of War series\n - Last of Us series\n - Uncharted series\n - Arkham series (Asylum mainly, the later ones start to not fit in this category I\u2019m describing and become too Ubisoft-y)\n - GTA 4, 5\n\n\nBad examples (as much as I also do enjoy them):\n - Half Life series (great games, story often takes backseat to large stretches of gameplay sandbox)\n - Ubisoft-y games open world games (Assassin\u2019s Creed, Far Cry, Spider-man)\n - Bethesda games\n - Disco Elysium (great game, too indie for what I\u2019m looking for at the moment)\n - Roguelikes \n \n\nEDIT (great suggestions from comments)\n\nDetroit: Become Human\nGod of War \nDeath Stranding\nBioshock ",

I could go on and on from Halo, Gears of War, Mass Effect, to Lost Odyssey. That being said, I never felt the need to purchase the XB1 and when I did play a few games at a friend's house, it still wasn't enough to make me buy the console.\n\nPS4 - Sony's 4th console was definitely my most played that generation and it did boast a variety of games, but even then the console remains sort of a blur to me when being compared to other PS systems. I'll always remember PS3 for PS HOME, Uncharted, Little Big Planet, Resistance, and The Last of Us but I just don't have the same feeling for the PS4. \n\nIf you had to pick either your least favorite generation or least played generation what would it be?",

The final game ever purchased was 'Star Wars: Battlefront 2' for the Xbox.\n\nI remember coming to check this store out the first weekend it opened. I was so excited at the idea of a store dedicated just to video games. At the time, this was some of the most exciting news of my entire life.\n\nI signed up for the power-up rewards program and a subscription to GameInformer magazine, within my first few visits. Over the next few years I spent almost all of my disposable income, and a significant portion of my free time, at this store. I enjoyed countless midnight release parties; where I made friends with customers and employees alike, as we bonded while waiting in line for the release of the newest game, and kept ourselves warm with the free domino's pizza provided at nearly every midnight release during the years I shopped here most. My first ever midnight release was for Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Don't tell management, but the employees broke street date and gave everyone the game about an hour early! I can't blame them for wanting to go home sooner. Most of us customers had been there waiting since just after sunset!\n\nI must have spent over 100 hours waiting at different midnight release parties, and another 100+ hours browsing the used game section whenever I had extra cash or someone wanted me to pick out a holiday gift for myself. I bought the first console I ever purchased with my own money at this store; an all white xbox one with Sunset Overdrive bundled alongside it. What a great game! What a great console... what a great store. And now all that is left is great memories. \n\nI shopped here for 14 years, purchased 100s of games, and collected the majority of the physcial game informers that were ever physically published... if i could go back and relive it all, I wouldn't change a single thing.\n\nGoodbye, GameStop. Power to the Players!",

        "selftext": "I suppose this is part legal question and part understanding how these companies operate. I'm not from the US so don't have experience with the nuances, but I do have a lot of experience working in the UK legal sector. Reading through the PAFFACAA, any major application that has over a million users and is more than 20% owned by a foreign adverary and also allows the sharing of text or other content can be banned. This seems to be irrespective of whether the owners/maintainers are based in the US or not. At the moment, 2(g)(3)(A) (sorry I'm not entirely sure how your laws are labelled - please correct me if that's wrong) specifically defines ByteDance and its subsidiaries but 2(g)(3)(B) implies the definition goes broader.\n\nThe reason I statted wondering was the banning of Marvel Snap. I know that Marvel Snap is banned because it's owned by a subsidiary of ByteDance, but I'm confused by the application of the Act here. Marvel Snap as a communication medium is very restricted and its development is US based, headed by Ben Brode et al. I quote their website: \"Second Dinner is an award-winning independent game studio based in California. We may be small, but our dreams are big! Let's make fun games together.\" So that means the \"more than 20% owned\" part is the offending clause if Marvel Snap is actually banned for being a product of its own. However, the Act seems to be a little clunky and inconsistent here, particularly 2(g)(3)(A) which seems to imply that ByteDance and all its subsidiaries must cease digital operations. It is very specifically targeting ByteDance regardless of the nature of the application itself. Mobile Legends Bang Bang also seems to be banned for the same reason as Marvel Snap.\n\nNow looking at Riot Games, it is a private company that is 93% owned by Tencent. If ByteDance is considered a foreign adversary due to risk of propaganda etc, then Tencent who was recently classified as a Chinese military company certainly should be too. All of Riot Games products allow communication and content sharing to the same degree that Marvel Snap does. Riot Games would not fall under the critical exemptions list. However, since Tencent is not defined specifically in 2(g)(3), **it falls to whether or not the President determines it a company that qualifies in accordance with 2(g)(3)(B)**. [Edit: people need to reread that last sentence several times before making assumptions about what I'm saying. At NO POINT did I say there would be an automatic ban for those in scope. The entire question is built on the premise that the process defined in 2(g)(3)(b) would be carried out which starts with the President defining the company as being a national security risk and taking it to Congress.] \n\nAt present the law seems to be very odd in its application. There doesn't seem to be a defined list of \"Foreign Controlled Adversaries\" besides ByteDance. I don't want to get into this part since it's literally how a foreign government (to me) works but this seems really sloppily written and gives the President the incredibly dangerous power to ban any digital product since the actual defined bar is so low (Chinese companies own more than 20% of a lot of tech companies) and the only thing protecting a company is the mercy of the President. I would be grateful if someone could look at this and tell me if my reading is correct, that Riot Games is within scope of this law and the President could decide to ban them at any time.\n\nEpic Games is a bit more nuanced, and potentially more dangerous if the government is against it. The company is US based but Tencent owns 48% of it [correction: 35% as of the latest statement we have from Epic]. Epic Games, however, has more applications that meet the criteria defined in the Act, particularly things like Fortnite Creative and Epic's wider (albeit still disappointing) social features. Now, **if the President defines Tencent and subsidiaries as foreign adversaries**, then Epic would go. But this then raises the question of what happens to Unreal. Since Epic would have to cease US based trade, does that mean their customers based in the US would have to drop the engine? I suspect that Epic could then meet the defined exemption since it would have a major impact on the US economy. However this presents a problem whereby the definition of Tencent as a foreign adversary is entirely up in the air.\n\nBefore finishing, I'll address the elephant in the room. Yes, I know this law specifically targets TikTok and ByteDance. I understand the political context behind it. But when reading laws you need to account for all the implications of it. At present, the President could overnight determine they don't like Riot Games and Epic Games and shut them down immediately. Legally, they would have no recourse other than the sale of their shares. For Riot Games that means selling 73+% of a very successful business. Riot Games is US based so ceasing operations is a huge deal for them. Objectively speaking, Tencent are as much a foreign adversary to the US as ByteDance. I am aware of theories that this law is performative and will be repealed very soon but right now it is law and the SCOTUS has upheld it. We don't know for sure where this goes. Regardless of how you feel about Riot or Epic (and to be clear I dislike both of them) or any of the other pies Tencent have their fingers in, the impact of this could be huge for the tech/gaming industry. I'll refrain from much commentary on the politicial implications of such power, but that scares me too.\n\nEdit: To clarify the question: I'm looking for a reason why these companies are out of scope that is supported in the definitions within the Act itself or perhaps within the court rulings in relation to it. I could have read it wrong, but there are a lot of assumptions about how this all works in the comments. To me, this is an incredibly sloppily written law and the scope of the power is huge, but I don't know if I'm missing some nuance as someone who isn't a US citizen or US legal professional.\n\nEdit 2: sigh... I love being downvoted in the comments for asking for reference to the law or other sources. I don't think people understand that I'm asking a question, not pushing something. I'm not saying \"omg they're going to ban rito\" or even \"they need to unban TikTok smh\". I'm asking from a place of academic interest and wanting to understand the impact of *the law* here. I have my political views, and yes that does include being worried about potentially abusable powers, but this is a really neutral question. I'm not a US citizen - your laws don't affect me directly, I can open TikTok right now or play Marvel Snap if I wanted to. I'm not Chinese either and I've been vocally critical of them too. I don't know how I can make it even clearer.",
